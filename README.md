Here's my Python project:

MATHROBOT

Its task: to solve (for now) the theorem of Pythagoras, a 6th-century BC mathematician best known for his theorem relating the sides of right triangles. MathRobot can also solve the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, which are part of trigonometry and relate the sides and angles of right triangles. There are two versions of MathRobot: one that runs on a terminal (VSCode) and another that is now available with Tkinter! Don’t forget to install Python on your computer via this link: https://www.python.org/.

To run the “terminal” program, download it, open it with a code editor (either an app or online at https://www.online-python.com/), and then launch it. After that, simply follow the instructions provided in the terminal. For Tkinter, it’s almost the same, except that you’ll need to run it in a desktop application, not online. Personally, I’ve only tested it on VSCode, so I’m not sure if it works with other applications. You just need to follow the same steps as with the terminal interface, but the graphical interface will open, and you’ll simply follow the instructions, this time with buttons and drop-down menus.

P.S. I’m a French developer, so my variables and def() functions will be written in French, but for easier reading, I’ve written all the interfaces (terminal and Tkinter) in English. Happy reading!
