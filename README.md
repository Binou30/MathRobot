Here's my Python project:

MATHROBOT

Its task: to solve (for now) the theorem of Pythagoras, a mathematician from the 6th century BC, best known for his theorem relating the sides of right triangles. MathRobot can also solve the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, which belong to the field of trigonometry and relate the sides and angles of right triangles. There are two versions of MathRobot: a version that runs on a terminal (VSCode) and a version now available with Tkinter!

P.S. : I'm a French developer, so my variables and def() will be written in French, but for more reading, I've put all the interfaces (terminal and Tkinter) in English. Happy reading!
