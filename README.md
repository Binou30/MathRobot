Here's my Python project:

MATHROBOT

Its task: to solve (for now) the theorem of Pythagoras, a mathematician from the 500s BC best known for his theorem relating the sides of right triangles. MathRobot can also solve the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, which belong to the field of trigonometry and relate the sides and angles of right triangles. There are two versions of MathRobot: one that runs on a terminal (VSCode) and one now available that runs using Tkinter!
