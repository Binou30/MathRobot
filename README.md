Here's my Python project:

MATHROBOT

Its task: to solve (for now) the theorem of Pythagoras, a 6th-century BC mathematician best known for his theorem relating the sides of right triangles. MathRobot can also solve the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, which belong to the field of trigonometry and relate the sides and angles of right triangles. There are two versions of MathRobot: one that runs on a terminal (VSCode) and one that's now available with Tkinter! Don't forget to install Python on your computer via this link: https://www.python.org/ . To run the "terminal" program, download it, open it with a code editor (app or online: https://www.online-python.com/), and then launch it. Then, simply follow the instructions given on the terminal. For Tkinter, it's almost the same, except you'll have to run it in an application, not online. Personally, I've only tested it on VSCode, so I don't know if it works on other applications. You'll just have to follow the same steps as with the terminal interface, but the interface will open, and you'll simply have to follow the instructions, but this time with buttons and drop-down menus.

P.S.: I'm a French developer, so my variables and def() will be written in French, but for easier reading, I've put all the interfaces (terminal and Tkinter) in English. Happy reading !
